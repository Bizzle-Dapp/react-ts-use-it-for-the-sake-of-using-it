# Welcome to React-TS-Use it for the sake of using it

ü§î Ever had that moment where you're doing something at work and suddenly you're like, 

### "I've done this before, I'm sure of it. It's in one of these projects on my GitHub... Was it..? No. Was it...? Hmm.. Where is it?"

Well that's why I decided to make this. Aim is to use all the tools in the box for the sake of having a quick reference on how I last used them.

# Stuff about this App:

## Available Scripts, always double check in package.json in case some crazy fool has changed them:

In the project directory from the terminal, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
