# Welcome to React-TS-Use it for the sake of using it

🤔 Ever had that moment where you're doing something at work and suddenly you're like, 

### "I've done this before, I'm sure of it. It's in one of these projects on my GitHub... Was it..? No. Was it...? Hmm.. Where is it?"

Well that's why I decided to make this. Aim is to use all the tools in the box for the sake of having a quick reference on how I last used them.

I feel i should extend the above now this repo has become a dumping ground of various prototypes and sanity checks of solution. 

This repo is literally my place to trial out solutions when needed before charging headlong into the problem in work environments.
